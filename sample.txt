If you want to run Docker containers on Windows, there are specific Windows-based Docker images that you can use, depending on whether you're using Windows Containers or Linux Containers on your Windows machine.

Windows-based Docker Images
To create or use a Windows-based Docker image, the image must be based on the Windows OS and work within the Windows Containers environment. These images are designed to run on Windows and are built with Windows Server or Windows 10 as the base operating system.

Common Windows Docker Images:
Microsoft Windows Server Core:

A Windows Server Core image provides a minimal version of the Windows Server operating system.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2022
Microsoft Windows Nano Server:

Nano Server is an even more lightweight version of Windows, designed for cloud and containerized environments.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022
Microsoft Edge:

There are official images for running Microsoft Edge on Windows.
Example:
Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.33.0-windows


Example of a Dockerfile for Windows Container:
To use a Windows base image with Playwright (for example, running on Edge and Chrome in a Windows environment), you can create a Dockerfile like this:

# Use Windows Server Core as base image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2022

# Install Playwright dependencies and browsers
RUN powershell -Command \
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/install-playwright -OutFile install-playwright.ps1; \
    .\install-playwright.ps1

# Expose the ports
EXPOSE 4444

# Set the entry point for running the tests
ENTRYPOINT ["C:\\path\\to\\your\\playwright\\test\\runner"]
