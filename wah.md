Accessibility Testing in Playwright: Step-by-Step Guide
This guide outlines the structure, configuration, and execution process for running accessibility tests in Playwright.

Folder Structure
playwright.accessibility.config.ts:
Contains the configuration details for running accessibility tests.
Reason:

Centralized configuration for readability and maintainability.
Facilitates easy updates without modifying test logic.
axe-config.json:
A JSON file where Axe configuration settings are defined.
Purpose:

Manage tags, disable rules, and exclude elements flexibly.
Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "tags": ["wcag2a", "wcag2aa"],
  "rules": {
    "color-contrast": { "enabled": false }
  },
  "exclude": [["#header"], [".skip-link"]]
}
Reason:

Keeps test configuration decoupled from code for easier customization and scalability.
config/axe-builder-config.ts:
Loads the axe-config.json and applies the configuration to the Axe builder.
Purpose:

Dynamically fetch and set configurations to ensure consistency in test runs.
Base Page with Fixture:
Axe configuration is applied to a base page via a Playwright fixture.
Reason:

Encapsulates the Axe setup logic to be reusable across all test files.
Simplifies test writing by allowing direct invocation of the scan() method.
Test Execution Workflow
1. Setup Configuration
Import the configurations from axe-config.json in axe-builder-config.ts.
Use the AxeBuilder instance to load the configurations dynamically.
typescript
Copy code
const axeConfig = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('axe-config.json', 'utf-8'));
const axeBuilder = new AxeBuilder(page).withTags(axeConfig.tags).disableRules(axeConfig.rules);
2. Apply Configuration via Fixture
Add a custom fixture in Playwright to set up Axe for each test file.
typescript
Copy code
test.use({
  axeConfig: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const config = new AxeBuilder(page).configureWith(axeConfig);
    await use(config);
  },
});
Set this fixture in your base page for easy access.
3. Scan Pages for Accessibility Violations
Call the scan() method in test files after setting up the configuration.
typescript
Copy code
const results = await basePage.scan();
expect(results.violations.length).toBe(0); // Assertion example
4. Aggregate Results
Store results after each test step into a results[] array.
typescript
Copy code
test.afterEach(async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  const stepResult = await basePage.scan();
  results.push(stepResult);
});
Publish a final consolidated report after all tests are executed.
Execution Details
Tests are run in the non-production environment immediately after code deployment.
Example Playwright command:
bash
Copy code
npx playwright test --project=nonProd
Future Scope
Adding More Flows:

Expand coverage by including more pages and user journeys.
Running on Different Browsers:

Enable cross-browser testing for broader compliance validation.
Integrate with CI Pipeline:

Automate accessibility tests in the UI CI pipeline to ensure compliance during every build.
Make it mandatory to block builds on critical violations.
Educate and Guide the Team:

Train team members on accessibility standards and the benefits of automated testing.
Add Hard Assertions for Critical Errors:

Ensure critical violations, such as contrast issues, fail the tests immediately to maintain standards.
Advantages of This Approach
Modular Configuration: Easy updates to accessibility rules and tags without modifying code.
Reusability: Fixture-based setup allows scalability across multiple test scenarios.
Continuous Improvement: Future scope aligns with evolving testing and accessibility needs.
By following this setup, your Playwright framework can efficiently identify and address accessibility violations, contributing to more inclusive and user-friendly applications.
